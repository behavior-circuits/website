When designing a utility systems using utility circuits there are two main considerations:
1. The design of the normalized utility functions
2. The design of the interconnecting circuit

There have been many good talks and articles on normalized utility design such as the [talk by Dave Mark](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1018040/Architecture-Tricks-Managing-Behaviors-in) on his infinite axis ai system (his portion starts at 33:40).
Or this [lecture from heidelberg university](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E81wGn75gqk&t=2194s) (in German) discussing utility and behavior circuits .

Because of the many different resources on the topic this page will only give a short summary on the design of utility functions and will instead focus on the design of the behavior circuit.

## Design of normalized utility functions.
